      <center>Reaction Machines</center>
     <h5> <p> "Reaction machines" is a broad term that can refer to various types of devices or systems designed to produce a reaction or response to a stimulus, input, or condition. The context in which the term is used can determine its specific meaning. Here are a few possible interpretations:</p></h5>

     <center>limited memory</center>
     <p>Limited memory is comprised of machine learning models that derive knowledge from previously-learned information, stored data, or events. Unlike reactive machines, limited memory learns from the past by observing actions or data fed to them in order to build experiential knowledge.</p>

     <center>Theory of Mind Ai</center>
     <p>
      The "Theory of Mind" (ToM) refers to the ability of an individual to attribute mental states—such as beliefs, intentions, desires, and emotions—to oneself and others and to understand that others may have different beliefs, intentions, and perspectives. In the context of artificial intelligence (AI), a "Theory of Mind AI" refers to a system that can understand, interpret, and respond to the mental states of other entities, be they humans or other AIs.</p>

     <center>Self Aware</center>
     <p>The concept of "self-aware AI" refers to artificial intelligence systems that possess some level of consciousness or self-awareness analogous to human self-awareness. Achieving true self-awareness in AI is a complex and philosophical challenge that extends beyond the current capabilities of existing technology. As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, no AI system has demonstrated genuine self-awareness.</p>
